## Welcome to my GitHub!

Hey there, my name is Allison. I am a grad student at Georgia Tech, enrolled in their Online Master of Analytics program. It's a unique program bringing together professionals and students from all over the world. 

I've set up this GitHub repository to be a homepage for random side projects or analyses I've decided to work on.

Feel free to check them out. Or head over to my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-feldman-0b99894b/) and connect with me there.
